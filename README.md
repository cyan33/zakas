# Zakas

> :robot: An AI bot to automate your daily life, implemented in Python.

Zakas is named after *[Nicolas Zakas](https://twitter.com/slicknet)*, who led me into the world of programming.

## Features

Try to say something to zakas!

* "What's the time?"
* "How old are you?"
* "Where is Raleigh?"

If you are thinking of something intereting that zakas might/should be able to do, feel free to open an issue!

## Usage

Install the dependencies:

```sh
brew install mpg321 portaudio
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And run the script (right now the simplest way to invoke zakas is to run the script, but in the future a GUI is definitely a good choice):

```sh
cd ./src && python zakas.py
```
